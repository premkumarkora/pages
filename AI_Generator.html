    <h1>Description of the Invention</h1>

    <h2>Field of the Invention</h2>
    <p>
        The present invention relates to artificial intelligence systems for healthcare. Specifically, it pertains to an AI-driven system that assists healthcare providers in real-time diagnosis and prescription generation using local and Transformer models, Distributed Learning, and a dual Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) process to ensure accuracy, safety, and privacy.
    </p>

    <h2>Background of the Invention</h2>
    <p>
        In healthcare, prescribing appropriate medication requires doctors to process large amounts of patient-specific data and integrate it with medical knowledge, such as historical prescriptions, drug safety guidelines, and clinical trials. Traditional systems suffer from several limitations:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Lack of Real-Time Assistance:</strong> Existing systems do not provide real-time prompts during doctor-patient discussions, often leading to incomplete or imprecise diagnosis.</li>
        <li><strong>Centralized Data Risks:</strong> Collecting and centralizing patient data creates privacy and security concerns.</li>
        <li><strong>Lack of Drug Safety Integration:</strong> Systems fail to consider adverse drug reactions (ADRs), drug-drug interactions, and up-to-date pharmacovigilance data.</li>
        <li><strong>Fragmented Historical Data:</strong> Prescription patterns and clinical insights are not effectively aggregated across healthcare providers.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        The current invention addresses these challenges by:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Processing real-time transcriptions during doctor-patient consultations.</li>
        <li>Using local and Base Transformer models to generate accurate, context-aware prescriptions.</li>
        <li>Integrating Distributed Learning for privacy-preserving historical data aggregation.</li>
        <li>Leveraging Validation Transformer model to validate prescriptions against external biomedical knowledge.</li>
        <li>Providing real-time prompts to doctors to improve diagnostic accuracy.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Summary of the Invention</h2>
    <p>
        The invention comprises a multi-layered AI system that assists in real-time diagnosis and prescription generation. It integrates the following key components:
    </p>

        <li><strong>Base Transformer Model:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Acts as the final prescription generator using a dual Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) process:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>First RAG Layer:</strong> Retrieves insights from the consolidated transcription data processed locally.</li>
                    <li><strong>Second RAG Layer:</strong> Retrieves biomedical knowledge from Validation Transformer model, including pharmacovigilance data, clinical trials, and drug safety databases.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Combines the two RAG inputs to generate a contextually accurate and safety-validated prescription.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>

            <ul>
                <li>Aggregates historical ailment-prescription data from distributed healthcare providers without centralizing sensitive patient information.</li>
                <li>Ensures prescriptions reflect real-world treatment trends across multiple providers.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>

            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Detailed Description of the Invention</h2>
    <h3>System Components</h3>
    <h4>Medical Transcription Module</h4>
    <p>
        Captures doctor-patient conversations using voice-to-text techniques. Generates accurate, real-time transcription data.
    </p>

    <h4>Local Transformer Model</h4>
    <p>
        Processes transcriptions locally on the doctorâ€™s computer to ensure speed and data privacy. Performs initial data structuring and insight extraction and provides real-time prompts to doctors to ensure complete and relevant patient information is collected. Outputs the consolidated transcription data as a structured query for the Base Transformer model.
    </p>

    <h4>Base Transformer Model</h4>
    <p>

        <li><strong>Layer 1:</strong> Retrieves context-aware insights from the local consolidated transcription.</li>
        <li><strong>Layer 2:</strong> Leverages Validation Transformer model to retrieve up-to-date biomedical knowledge from pharmacovigilance systems, clinical trials data, and drug interaction databases.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Combines the retrieved data to generate a safe and contextually appropriate prescription.</p>

    <h4>Distributed Learning Module</h4>
    <p>
        Aggregates historical prescription patterns from distributed healthcare providers. Updates model weights periodically without centralizing sensitive patient data. Ensures prescriptions are validated against real-world clinical trends.
    </p>

    <h4>Dual Prescription Validation</h4>
    <p>
        Combines outputs from Validation Transformer model (safety validation) and FL (historical accuracy) to ensure reliable prescriptions.
    </p>

    <h4>Prescription Delivery and Pharmacy Integration</h4>
    <p>
        Prescriptions are displayed to doctors for review and transmitted to pharmacies. Pharmacies generate appropriate drug documentation, ensuring compliance and transparency.

        <li>Consolidated transcription data is sent as input to the Base Transformer Model.</li>
        <li>The Base Transformer performs dual RAG:
            <ul>
                <li>Retrieves insights from local transcription data.</li>
                <li>Retrieves biomedical knowledge from Validation Transformer model.</li>
