-> Imagine you're building a Student Support with Retrieval-Augmented Generation AI that needs to handle queries about Academic Resources, Student FAQs, and Campus & Administrative Support. You could dump all your documents into a single vector database, but that would be like having a library of all mixed together. Not very efficient, right?
-> Traditional RAG systems treat all documents uniformly, leading to slower search times and diluted results. What if we could automatically route queries to the most relevant database while maintaining high performance?
-> We use a sophisticated RAG system with intelligent database routing that uses multiple specialized vector databases (Academic Resources, Student FAQs, and Campus & Administrative Support) with an agent-based router to direct queries to the most relevant database. 

The multiAgent uses:
Langchain for RAG orchestration
Phidata as the router agent to determine the most relevant database for a given query
LangGraph as a fallback mechanism, utilizing DuckDuckGo for web research when necessary
Streamlit for a user-friendly interface for document upload and querying
Qdrant for storing and retrieving document embeddings
GTP-4o for answer synthesis

-> The COLLECTIONS dictionary now defines three collections—Academic Resources, Student FAQs, and Campus & Administrative Support—each with its own Qdrant collection name.
-> The routing agent has been modified to consider the three student collections. It uses both vector similarity scores and a fallback LLM-based routing agent to determine the best collection for a given student query.
-> The document upload section now creates a separate tab for each collection, allowing you to upload PDFs that populate the corresponding database.
-> When a question is submitted, the code routes the query to the most appropriate collection based on similarity scores (or LLM fallback if needed) and then returns an answer using retrieval-augmented generation.

How It Works
1. Query Routing
Our system directs your questions with a refined three-step process:

Vector Similarity Search: It scans all available databases to pinpoint the most relevant content.
LLM-Based Routing: For ambiguous queries, our language model steps in to fine-tune the routing decision.
Web Search Fallback: If the topic is unfamiliar, the system gracefully turns to web research for additional insights.
2. Document Processing
Your documents are transformed with precision and care:

Automated Text Extraction: PDFs are seamlessly converted into text.
Intelligent Chunking: The text is thoughtfully segmented into overlapping chunks to maintain context.
Vector Embedding Creation: Each segment is converted into vector embeddings for effective retrieval.
Efficient Storage: These embeddings are organized and stored in our optimized databases.
3. Answer Generation
The system crafts responses that are both accurate and contextually aware:

Context-Aware Retrieval: It identifies and retrieves the most pertinent information.
Smart Document Combination: Relevant segments are intelligently merged to form a comprehensive answer.
Confidence-Based Responses: The system ensures responses are delivered with measurable confidence.
Integrated Web Research: When necessary, external web research is incorporated to enhance the answer.
